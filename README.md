# http-signature-examples

Here you can find some examples on how to create the necessary HTTP
Signatures for the Upvest Investment API.

For now, the most mature examples are the Python and Javascript ones. We will update the
other examples shortly and create further ones as necessary.

To get started, we suggest reading the documentation on
[implementing signatures, in our official API documentation](https://docs.upvest.co/tutorials/implementing_http_signatures).

To continue with the Python or the Javascript example, we suggest reading the respective README:
- [Python README](./Python/README.md).
- [Javascript README](./Javascript/README.md).
