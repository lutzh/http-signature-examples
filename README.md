# http-signature-examples

Here you can find some examples on how to create the necessary HTTP
Signatures for the Upvest Investment API.

For now, the most mature example is the Python one. We will update the
other examples shortly and create further ones as necessary.

To get started, we suggest reading the [README in the Python
example](./Python/README.md) and the documentation on [implementing
signatures, in our official API
documentation](https://docs.upvest.co/tutorials/implementing_http_signatures).
